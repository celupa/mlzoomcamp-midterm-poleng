# Demographic and Socio-Economic Predictors of Political Engagement
<br/>

## Context 
What aspects of a person's life influences their political engagement? 

The **World Values Survey** (WVS) is an organization analyzing people's values on a global scale.
They have been running the experiment for more than 40 years. 
Their questionnaire covers features such as personal values, wellbeing, political perceptions...

This is the first part of 3 series project.
In this section, we'll predict political engagement via high-level dimensions such as sex, education level...
The second project will analyse political engagement by adding more complex variables (e.g., political perception).
The final project will analyse the evolution of political engagement over the years.

## Rationale
I believe it's useful to understand what makes a particular person "politically" engaged or not.
Whether we are aware of, adhering or not to this idea, we are political creatures, living in a political world.
Voting and asking for that succulent piece of bread at the table both rely on political undertones.
Both of these actions involve the individual's relationship with their past and format their future.  

The easy way out lies in political apathy. 
If, for whatever reason, we relinquish our political momentum, we lose, among other valuable things, our voice to the table.

Understanding political profiles would help us:
* **Inform** about the consequences of political engagement 
* **Prevent** political manipulation by identifying vulnerable populations 
* **Support** intervention campaigns to revigorate political engagement
* **Protect** systems and citizens of political decay by keeping track of political public sentiment over time
* ...

## Data
The data is free to use but is not distributable.
You can find the data and related in-depth documentation here (Wave 7) here: https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp
The 7th wave ran from 2017 to 2022, after which the results were consolidated in one comprehensive dataset.

For our current purpose, here are the column that we have retained for analysis:
